# [Add up the numbers from a single number](https://edabit.com/challenge/4gzDuDkompAqujpRi)

<!--
 The function takes an integer as a parameter and adds up that integer with every integer before it till 1
 addUp(3) will add up 3+2+1 and return an integer of 6
-->

## Syntax

> addUp(`number`) -> `number`

### Parameters

**integer**: `number`

- any positive integer numbers

### Return Value: `number`

- a positive integer number greater than or equal to the parameter

## Test Cases

<!--
  copy in the test cases from the original challenge

  if you write your own test cases in a sandbox file, include those too
-->

```js
addUp(4) ➞ 10

addUp(13) ➞ 91

addUp(600) ➞ 180300
```

## Use Cases

<!--
  write a minimum of 2 use cases to show this functions behavior.

  try to find interesting _edge cases_, it's good for you ;)
  an edge case is when a function behaves different than you'd expect.
  This will help you and others better understand the function.

```js

console.log(addUp(4)) // 10
console.log(addUp(13)) // 91
console.log(addUp(600)) // 180300
```
